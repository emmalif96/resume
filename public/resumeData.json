    "bio":"I grew up on a farm in Fljótsdalur, near Egilsstaðir in East Iceland. I am half Australian and have Australian citizenship, and when I was 14 years old I moved there with my family. I moved back to Iceland when I began upper secondary school. As soon as I graduated I moved to Denmark to chase my hobbies and spend a year attending a sports school. On my return to Iceland I commenced my degree with the University of Iceland.",
    "bio1":"Gymnastics has played a major role in my life and is my main hobby. I practiced it for most of my primary school years and since I started in upper secondary school I have been coaching competitive gymnastic teams and travelled the country to attend competitions. I hold a gymnastics judges certificate and today I am a well-respected gymnastics judge. Throughout my childhood I practiced chess and I was considered good at it considering that I won many trophies. When I was young I did a lot of horse riding and spent my summers with my family guiding tourists on the highlands.",
